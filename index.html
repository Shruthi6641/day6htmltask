        <h1>PROJECTS:</h1>
        <h3>HAND TALK: SIGN LANGUAGE TO TEXT CONVERTER USING CNN (11/2023-4/2024)</h3>
        <ul type="disc"></ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented a CNN model trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset consisting of 
            over 10,000 images to recognize and classify 50 different hand gestures.</li>
            <li>  Built a user-friendly interface for real-time image processing, capable of translating gestures 
            into text output within 0.5 seconds.</li>
            <li> The system was tested for accuracy and robustness, achieving a 95% accuracy rate, making it a 
            practical tool for enhanced communication accessibility. </li>
            <br>
            <h3>PNEUMONIA DETECTION FROM CHEST X-RAYS USING CNN (06/2023-11/2024)</h3>
            <ul type="disc"></ul>
            <li> Developed a machine learning model using a CNN to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray 
            images with over 90% accuracy. </li>
            <li> Designed a CNN architecture to classify X-ray images as pneumonia-positive or healthy, 
            achieving 92% sensitivity. </li>
            <li> Preprocessed a dataset of 5,000 labeled X-rays, using data augmentation and normalization to enhance model performance. </li>
